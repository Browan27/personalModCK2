EVTIM.1;You’re feeling lucky today, and a strange sense to make a wish comes over  you, and you go to the castle well. You’re about to flip a coin, and you make a wish. What do you wish for?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.2;Immortality; nothing is better than living forever in a luxurious life such as my own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.3;To be rid of this damn curse; I never should wished for it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.4;This is a waste of my time! I already have everything I ever wanted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.5;You feel a strange air around you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.6;Let the immortal strength transform you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.7;You happen upon a small cavern. At the end, you see a chest, shimmering with hidden relics and other valuables. However, the way there and back is dangerous, and you could fall off. Is it worth that risk?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.8;Of course! I live for money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.9;No way! I like my legs nice and straight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.10;I managed to make it across the cavern without toppling off. This treasure is all mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.11;As I slowly meander my way across, I stumble and fall off the passageway!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.12;Now I'm richer than an emperor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.13;That hurt... Good thing I'm immortal, but this will take a while to heal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.10_tooltip;your character makes it across;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.11_tooltip;your character plummets to the bottom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.14;You wake one early morning. Your head is clear, and you can finally think clearly. It seems that the gods have assisted you in your time of need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.15;You finally lose that feeling you had that you were a bumbling idiot and go back to taking over the world!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.16;You're laying outside late at night, staring up at the stars, when you suddenly realize something: You don't feel downright trodden! You feel uplifted with joy as you realize your infirmity is gone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.17;Your life feels rejuvenated, and you’re ready to conquer the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.18;One day while bathing the servant assisting your maimed body scurries off. Frustrated, you exit and retrieve your own clothing. While fastening your top, you realize you walked straight without hobbling!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.19;Your everlasting strength is assured! Back to world conquest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.20;That throbbing pain is finally gone. Didn't even leave a scar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.21;This immortal thing has its perks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.22;With your immortality, you ponder the nature of existence more often than most. Today's topic: fear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.23;With immortality, what should I possibly fear!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTIM.24;Times have been hard lately. With all the world domination, even immortal you is starting to feel the pressure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
